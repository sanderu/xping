.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple PING program continiously probing multiple hosts using
ICMP-ECHO. As packets are received dots are printed on the screen.
Hosts not responding before next packet is due will get a questionmark
in the display. The probing stops when SIGINT is received. Host to be
probed are taken from argument list or read from stdin.
